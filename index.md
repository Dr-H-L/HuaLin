>   I am a child development and family scientist and quantitative research methodologist and serves as a post-doctoral fellow working in the Department of Human Development and Family Science at Oklahoma State University. 
>
> As a child development and family scientist, my research interests are parenting and the development of parent-child interactions, in that I am focusing on momentary parenting goals, parental competency, social withdrawal, and immigrant youth well-being. I was certified by Active Parenting in 2015 for teaching “Active parenting 4th edition” and “Parenting Your 1- to 4-Year-Old.”
>
> As a research methodologist, I am focusing on cross-cultural psychometric appropriations (including Item Response Theory), statistic model comparison (mediation moderation, propensity score matching, dual-centered ANCOVA, etc.), and making causal inferences in non-randomized studies. I have been certified by Data Carpentry to teach data management and statistic programs in Data Carpentry Workshop (e.g., Introduction to R) and Software Workshop (e.g., Python).
